## Description

This is legendary Machine Learning Challenging datasets for prediction of survivor from Titanic shipwreck.

On April 15, 1912 , During her first marine voyage, named 'unsinkable ' RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg.

Unfortunately, there weren't enough lifeboats for passengers on board so that over 60% of passengers were thrown to death.
